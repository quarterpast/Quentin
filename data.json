We'll be staying in the [Generator Hostel](http://www.generatorhostels.com/en/berlin), and I'm sure you'll appreciate the included breakfast.\n\nThe price for the week will be £230, which includes transport, accommodation and breakfast for the week. We will be catching the [Megabus](http://megabus.com) down to London Victoria then the National express train to Stansted, where we'll stay the night until our 6am departure[^1]. On the way back, we're only going as far as London Victoria, as not many of you will be returning to campus.\n\nThe deadline for payments is Monday Week 3 (10/5/10); you can pay online through the [SU Website](http://www.warwicksu.com/shop/product/10052180/).\n\nWe look forward to seeing you guys there.
